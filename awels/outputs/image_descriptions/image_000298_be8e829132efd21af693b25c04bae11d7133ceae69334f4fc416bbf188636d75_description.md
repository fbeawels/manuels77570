# Detailed Description of the Image

## Summary
The image appears to be a technical diagram or schematic related to heating systems, specifically a heat pump system by Dedietrich. It includes various components and labels that describe different parts of the system. The layout is structured with clear sections for different elements, making it easy to understand the overall design and functionality.

## Overall Layout and Structure
The image has a vertical orientation with dimensions 368x483 pixels. The layout is divided into several distinct sections, each containing different components of the heat pump system. The top section includes a title or header, followed by a main diagram area that occupies most of the image. Below this, there are smaller sections for additional information and labels.

## Main Components and Their Arrangement
1. **Header Section**: Located at the top, this section contains the title "Pompe à Chaleur Dedietrich" (Dedietrich Heat Pump) in bold letters.
2. **Main Diagram Area**: This is the largest section, occupying the central part of the image. It includes various components such as pipes, valves, pumps, and other mechanical parts arranged in a schematic format.
3. **Labeling Section**: Below the main diagram area, there are smaller sections with labels and additional information about each component.
