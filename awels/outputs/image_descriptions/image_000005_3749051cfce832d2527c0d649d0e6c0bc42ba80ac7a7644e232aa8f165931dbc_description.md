   - Shows the external structure with labeled parts such as the water tank, coffee grinder, and control panel.

2. **Middle Sections**:
   - Detailed diagrams or exploded views of internal components.
   - Each section focuses on a specific part (e.g., water flow system, heating element, brewing mechanism).
   - Components are arranged in a logical sequence, likely following the path of coffee preparation from water intake to brewed coffee output.

3. **Bottom Section**:
   - Includes additional diagrams or illustrations that might show maintenance procedures or troubleshooting tips.
   - Possibly includes icons or symbols representing different functions or parts.

### Visual Elements (Colors, Styles, Icons)
- **Color Scheme**: Primarily uses a combination of blue, white, and gray.
  - **Blue**: Used for highlighting important components and text.
  - **White**: Background color, providing contrast and clarity.
  - **Gray**: Used for less critical elements and shading to give depth.

- **Styles**:
  - Clean and modern design with sharp lines and clear labeling.
  - Use of arrows and dotted lines to indicate connections or flow paths within the machine.

- **Icons**:
  - Small icons next to text labels, representing different parts (e.g., water droplet for water tank, coffee bean for grinder).
  - Icons are stylized and consistent in design, enhancing readability.

### Text Content and Formatting
- **Font**: Sans-serif font, likely Arial or Helvetica, for a modern and readable appearance.
- **Size**: Varies depending on the importance of the text; larger fonts for section headers and smaller fonts for detailed labels.
- **Color**: Black for main text, blue for highlighted terms or important instructions.
- **Formatting**:
  - Headers are bolded and slightly larger than body text.
  - Bullet points or numbered lists used for step-by-step instructions.

### Distinctive Features or Patterns
- **Annotations**: Extensive use of annotations to explain each component's function.
- **Cross-referencing**: Arrows and lines connecting different parts, showing how they interact.
- **Consistency**: Uniform design language throughout the image, making it easy to follow despite the complexity.
