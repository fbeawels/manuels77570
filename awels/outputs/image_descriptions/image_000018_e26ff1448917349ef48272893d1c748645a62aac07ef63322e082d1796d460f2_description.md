## Overall Layout and Structure

- **Orientation**: Portrait (24x18 dimensions)
- **Layout**: The image is divided into several distinct sections, each highlighting different components of the coffee machine.
- **Structure**: The layout follows a logical flow from top to bottom, with larger components at the top and smaller, more detailed parts towards the bottom.

## Main Components and Their Arrangement

1. **Top Section**:
   - **Water Reservoir**: Positioned at the very top, likely indicating its importance in the machine's operation.
   - **Control Panel**: Located just below the water reservoir, featuring various buttons and indicators.

2. **Middle Section**:
   - **Grinder**: Situated centrally, with visible grinding mechanisms.
   - **Brewing Unit**: Directly beneath the grinder, showing the path of coffee grounds through the brewing process.
   - **Heating Element**: Positioned near the brewing unit, essential for heating water.

3. **Bottom Section**:
   - **Drip Tray**: Located at the base, collecting any excess liquid.
   - **Coffee Outlet**: Just above the drip tray, where the brewed coffee is dispensed.

## Visual Elements (Colors, Styles, Icons)

- **Color Scheme**:
  - **Primary Colors**: Shades of gray and white, giving a technical and clean look.
