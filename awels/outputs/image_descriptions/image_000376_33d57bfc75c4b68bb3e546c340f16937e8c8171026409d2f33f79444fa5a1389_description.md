# Description of Microwave Artifact Image

## Summary
The image appears to be a detailed illustration or diagram related to the internal components of a Whirlpool microwave oven. The purpose seems to be instructional, providing a clear view of various parts and their arrangement within the appliance.

## Overall Layout and Structure
- **Dimensions**: 54x49 pixels.
- **Aspect Ratio**: Slightly wider than it is tall, giving a horizontal orientation.
- **Layout**: The image is densely packed with detailed components, suggesting a technical diagram or exploded view of the microwave's interior.

## Main Components and Their Arrangement
1. **Microwave Cavity**:
   - Positioned centrally in the image.
   - Likely represents the main cooking chamber where food is placed.
2. **Magnetron**:
   - Located at the top right corner.
   - This component generates microwaves for heating food.
3. **Waveguide**:
   - Connects the magnetron to the microwave cavity, positioned diagonally from the magnetron to the cavity.
4. **Turntable**:
   - Situated in the center of the microwave cavity.
   - Ensures even cooking by rotating the food.
5. **Control Panel**:
   - Positioned at the top left corner.
   - Contains buttons and displays for user interaction.
