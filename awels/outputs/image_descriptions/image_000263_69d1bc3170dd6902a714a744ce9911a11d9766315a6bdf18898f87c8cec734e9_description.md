# Whirlpool Microwave Artifact Image

## Summary of Main Content and Purpose
The image appears to be a detailed illustration or diagram related to the internal components of a Whirlpool microwave oven. The purpose seems to be instructional, providing a clear view of various parts and their arrangement within the appliance.

## Detailed Description

### Overall Layout and Structure
- **Dimensions**: 31x27 pixels.
- **Layout**: The image is densely packed with detailed line art, showing multiple components in a compact space. The layout suggests a cross-sectional or exploded view to reveal internal structures.

### Main Components and Their Arrangement
- **Microwave Cavity**: Central part of the image, likely representing the cooking chamber.
- **Magnetron**: Positioned at the top left, connected to the waveguide.
- **Waveguide**: Extends from the magnetron to the cavity, directing microwaves into the cooking area.
- **Turntable Motor and Plate**: Located in the center of the cavity, essential for rotating food evenly.
- **Control Panel**: At the bottom right, showing buttons and a display.
- **Ventilation System**: Includes fans and vents at various points to ensure proper airflow.

### Visual Elements (Colors, Styles, Icons)
- **Color Scheme**:
  - **Black and White**: The image is predominantly in black and white, with some gray shading for depth.
  - **High Contrast**: Sharp contrast between the components and background, making details easily distinguishable.
- **Styles**:
  - **Line Art**: Clean, precise lines used to define each component.
  - **Shading**: Light gray shading adds a sense of depth and dimension to certain parts.
- **Icons/Markers**:
  - **Labels**: Small text labels next to various components for identification (e.g., "Magnetron," "Waveguide").
  - **Arrows**: Directional arrows indicating the flow of microwaves or airflow.

### Text Content and Formatting
