# Whirlpool Microwave Artifact Image

## Summary of Main Content and Purpose
The image appears to be a detailed illustration or diagram of an artifact related to the Whirlpool microwave. It likely serves as a technical reference or instructional guide, providing insights into the internal components and structure of the appliance.

## Detailed Description

### Overall Layout and Structure
- **Dimensions**: The image is 46 pixels wide by 37 pixels high.
- **Aspect Ratio**: The aspect ratio is approximately 1.24:1 (width to height).
- **Layout**: The layout is compact, with a focus on detailed components rather than extensive background elements.

### Main Components and Their Arrangement
- **Central Component**: The central part of the image features what appears to be a cross-sectional view or exploded diagram of a microwave component.
- **Surrounding Elements**: There are smaller, less prominent components surrounding the central element, likely representing additional parts or accessories related to the microwave.

### Visual Elements (Colors, Styles, Icons)
