# Manuels 77570 Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Manuels 77570 Knowledge Base repository. This project comprises a comprehensive collection of documentation and images processed to create a well-structured database suitable for retrieval and context generation. The repository utilizes advanced tools and techniques to manage and analyze the repository's assets efficiently.

## Repository

- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/fbeawels/manuels77570.git](https://github.com/fbeawels/manuels77570.git)

## Project Overview

This knowledge base project processes a large volume of documentation and image files to populate a sophisticated vector database. The database facilitates quick retrieval and contextual generation using advanced machine learning models. It is designed to support AI-driven applications by offering detailed insights through analyzed contents.

## Processing Summary

The project involves thorough analysis and processing across three dimensions: code, documentation, and images. The statistics for processed files and database collections are as follows:

- **Code Files Processed:** 0
- **Documentation Files Processed:** 9
- **Image Files Processed:** 1252

## Tools Used

The following tools and models have been employed in the project's processing pipeline:

- **Language Model (LLM):** OpenAI GPT-4o for contextual generation and code analysis.
- **Embeddings Model:** Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` model for generating text embeddings.
- **Vector Database:** Qdrant serves as the vector database for storing and querying the processed data.
- **Code Analysis Script:** `build_code.py` is used for analyzing code-related files.
- **Document Analysis Script:** `build_doc.py` handles the processing and analysis of documentation files.
- **Image Analysis Script:** `build_multi.py` is used for image file analysis.

## Statistics

Here are the detailed statistics for the vector database collections and their respective point counts:

| Collection Type          | Collection Name            | Points Count |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Code Collection**      | 77570-manuals-code         | 0 points     |
| **Documentation Collection** | 77570-manuals-doc      | 2153 points  |
| **Image Collection**     | 77570-manuals-multi        | 1252 points  |

## Generated Files

As part of the project's output, the following files have been generated to facilitate enhanced interaction and functionality:

- **CONTEXT.md:** Provides detailed context about the repository and its contents.
- **PROMPT.md:** Contains the system prompt intended for use with the AI agent.
- **SPECS.md:** Enlists specifications for creating a Langflow agent, essential for certain automation tasks.
